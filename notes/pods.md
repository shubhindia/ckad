## Some basic concepts of writing yamls

	1. There are 4 main components of any kubernetes yaml
		a. apiVersion (this specifies which apiVersion we will be using)
		b. kind (this specifies which kind of objects we will be using. eg. pod/deployment/service etc)
		c. metadata (as the name suggests this is data i.e basic info about our object which we will be deploying)
		d. spec (this section specifies all the parameters for our object like name, imagename etc)
