## Deployments
    1. It is very similar to replicaset object of kubernetes except for the fact 
        that we are creating a deployment object instead of replicaset. 
    2. Other than this difference, there is no difference in the yaml itself but 
        functionality wise they differ. There are many advantages of using a deployment over replicaset.
